*******************************
Setting up the test environment
*******************************

With this software package you should be able to test both a client
implementation as well as a server implementation.

The necessary configuration differs between testing a client and a server and
 also testing an OAuth2 or an OpenID Connect implementation

The overall pattern are the same, you have to define::

    * which flow you are testing
    * the client and server configuration
    * possible interactions

More about this in the specific areas.
